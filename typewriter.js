// perhaps in order to display the characters one at a time
// we will want to have a loop to call each letter out one by one
// and the appearing sound will be picked randomly and added to the letter
// letters will be called by their index
// calling with a delay when they appear
// same as while loop? or something, wild? the idea is that we are able to use delay

//once the sentence is completed, we want to delete the clear the string again;
